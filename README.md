# udp-latency
A single Python file end-to-end latency testing tool based on UDP üìà. 

Support both one-way and round-trip latency measurement:
- `udp_latency.py` measures one-way latency.
- `udp_rrt.py` measures round-trip latency. (both with same arguments)

## Time synchronization (--sync)

‚ö†Ô∏è Udp-latency (one-way) requires precise synchronization (same clock time) between server and clients. The basic idea for my implementation is from [IEEE PTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol) protocol.

![ptp](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/IEEE1588_1.jpg)

In the first 10 seconds before measurement, PTP events are exchanged per second to calculate **time offset** between the server and clients. To avoid the impact on the experimental traffic, *it stops sending PTP messages during the experiment and neglects the time drifting.*

Udp-rrt doesn't rely on synchronization.



## Dynamic adaption (--dyna)

‚ö†Ô∏è  This method will slightly damage the periodicity. (Small jitter contains with this additional bandwidth optimization)

    Due to the non-deterministic delay in `socket.sendto()` system call, it is difficult to maintain a constant sending bandwidth/frequency. For example, you want to send flow in 5 Mbits with `-m` argument (for a 100 byte packet in 1 Gbs linkspeed, you call `socket.sendto` every 2.5 us in Python interpreter), however, the sending speed can be only 3 Mbits when there is an around 1.67 us delay in `socket.sendto()` system call. Furthermore, this delay can be different using kernel scheduling policy and system workload making it hard to bound or estimate (See the following figure about the delay measurement).

![figure](./Processing-delay-distribution.png)

To alleviate this problem here, this code uses a greedy method to adjust sending frequency dynamically (like PID control):

$$
NewFrequency = \frac{ExpectedFrequency}{DecayedRate}, ExpectedFrequency = \frac{CurrentFrquency \times RunningTime}{RemaingTime}, DecayedRate = \frac{CurrentFrequency}{Global Frequency}
$$

Where $CurrenctFrequency$ is the accumulated frequency from the program beginning to the current time. $GlobalFrequency$ is the frequency user set with `-f` or `-m` argument. $RunningTime$ and $RemainingTime$ are the time from the programming beginning time and time to the programming ending time defined by `-t` argument respectively.

During the local test through `127.0.0.1`, the gap between realistic and expected bandwidth is bounded within 1%, the difference can be 30% without dynamic adaption.
